As per the given data, we can see that “Houchens - Stollings_Video” has highest Impressions among the whole data. However, it has only 0.08% CTR rate which less than the average rate 0.2% and has one of the highest Drop Rate (Users who started the video but didn’t complete the video) of 43.42%.
We can clearly see how the highest number of Impressions and clicks doesn’t in turn provide highest CTR%. “Gibbs Linda John_Comp_OTT (18296835) and Gibbs Linda John_Comp_Video (18296836)” even though had the least number of Impressions among the entire data, turned out to be the Line Items with the Highest CTR%.
 
(Top 15 Line Items wrt. CTR% and Imps, Clicks on the Line)

As we can interpret from the chart below, some Line Items like “Kute Steve, Kute Craig and Goodwin” even though doesn’t have least Impressions, the Clicks and CPR rate is 0%. Most of the users complete the video that is being displayed but their INTEREST COULDN’T BE TURNED TO ACTION which is evident from their CTR rate. The marketing team can pull out the amount from these Line Items and can instead put the amount into Gibbs Linda John and other higher CPR rated Line Items.

Some interesting Line Items are Corporate_Video (17826481) – Even though it had one of the highest Impressions among the data, it had one of the least CPR rate (0.05%). Nearly top 10-12 items with highest Impressions had very low CTR rate. “Taylor, Rod & Angela_OTT (17824976), Botros, Jacob_OTT (17826524)” despite having an average no. of impressions, it served one of the highest CTRs among all the items.
The marketing team can pull some money out of these items and can spend more on the items that are in turn producing highest CTR rates despite their low impressions and clicks.

 
Drop Rate = (Video starts – 100% completion Rate)

We can observe that if the Drop Rate is greater than 24% i.e., if approximately more than one fourth of the users move away before the completion of the Video that is being advertised, they are less likely turn into action that the company wants to. The marketing team may needs to work on how exactly they need to draw user’s attention and engage them with the video/ad and convert that visit/click to action.
